### Service Discovery, Scaling, and Load Balancing in Kubernetes

Kubernetes provides powerful mechanisms for service discovery, scaling, and load balancing to ensure that applications can handle varying loads and remain highly available. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of these concepts with examples.

---

### **1. Service Discovery**

Service discovery in Kubernetes allows applications to find and connect to other services and Pods within the cluster. Kubernetes Services provide a stable endpoint for Pods, abstracting their dynamic nature.

#### **1.1. Service Types**

- **ClusterIP**: The default service type, exposing the service on an internal IP address only accessible within the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a static port on each Node, allowing external access.
- **LoadBalancer**: Provisioned by cloud providers, exposing the service via an external load balancer.
- **Headless**: No cluster IP is assigned, allowing direct access to Pods.

**Example: Expose a Deployment with ClusterIP**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

**Accessing the Service Internally**

```sh
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- curl http://my-service
```

**Example: Expose a Deployment with LoadBalancer**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-loadbalancer-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

**Accessing the Service Externally**

```sh
kubectl get services
```

The external IP assigned by the cloud provider will be used to access the service.

### **2. Scaling**

Scaling in Kubernetes involves adjusting the number of Pods running a particular application to handle varying loads. Kubernetes supports both manual and automated scaling.

#### **2.1. Manual Scaling**

You can manually scale the number of replicas of a Deployment or StatefulSet using `kubectl`.

**Example: Scale a Deployment**

```sh
kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas=5
```

**Verify Scaling**

```sh
kubectl get deployments
```

#### **2.2. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**

HPA automatically scales the number of Pods in a Deployment or StatefulSet based on CPU utilization or custom metrics.

**Example: Create an HPA**

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-deployment
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
```

**Apply HPA**

```sh
kubectl apply -f my-hpa.yaml
```

**Monitor HPA**

```sh
kubectl get hpa
```

#### **2.3. Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)**

VPA adjusts the resource requests and limits of Pods based on their usage.

**Example: Create a VPA**

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "VerticalPodAutoscaler"
metadata:
  name: my-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind: "Deployment"
    name: my-deployment
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto"
```

**Apply VPA**

```sh
kubectl apply -f my-vpa.yaml
```

**Monitor VPA**

```sh
kubectl get vpa
```

---

### **3. Load Balancing**

Load balancing in Kubernetes distributes network traffic evenly across multiple Pods to ensure high availability and efficient resource utilization.

#### **3.1. Load Balancing with Services**

- **ClusterIP**: Provides internal load balancing within the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a static port across all nodes, balancing external traffic.
- **LoadBalancer**: Uses an external load balancer provided by cloud providers to distribute traffic.

**Example: Load Balancer Service**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-loadbalancer-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

**Verify Load Balancer**

```sh
kubectl get services
```

The external IP will be assigned by the cloud provider and used for accessing the service.

#### **3.2. Ingress Controller**

Ingress controllers provide HTTP and HTTPS routing and load balancing for services. They are used to manage traffic from outside the cluster to internal services.

**Example: Install NGINX Ingress Controller**

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

**Example: Create an Ingress Resource**

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: my-app.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

**Apply Ingress**

```sh
kubectl apply -f my-ingress.yaml
```

**Verify Ingress**

```sh
kubectl get ingress
```
