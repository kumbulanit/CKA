**Steps**:
1. **Plan the Upgrade**:
   - Review Kubernetes release notes and documentation for new features and breaking changes.
   - Test the upgrade process in a staging environment before applying it to production.

2. **Upgrade Control Plane**:
   - **Kubeadm**: Use `kubeadm upgrade` to upgrade control plane components.
     ```sh
     kubeadm upgrade apply v1.23.0
     ```
   - **Managed Services**: Use cloud provider tools or console for managed Kubernetes services.

3. **Upgrade Nodes**:
   - Drain the node:
     ```sh
     kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
     ```
   - Upgrade the node software and Kubernetes components.
   - Rejoin the node to the cluster:
     ```sh
     kubectl uncordon <node-name>
     ```

4. **Upgrade Add-ons**:
   - Upgrade add-ons like CoreDNS, metrics server, and storage classes.

5. **Verify Upgrade**:
   - Check the status of nodes and pods.
     ```sh
     kubectl get nodes

   - Check resource usage with `kubectl top`:
     ```sh
     kubectl top nodes
     kubectl top pods
     ```

2. **Scale Resources**:
   - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on CPU or memory usage.
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2
     kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
     metadata:
       name: my-app-hpa
     spec:
       scaleTargetRef:
         apiVersion: apps/v1
         kind: Deployment
         name: my-app
       minReplicas: 1
       maxReplicas: 10
       metrics:
       - type: Resource
         resource:
           name: cpu
           target:
             type: Utilization
             averageUtilization: 50
     ```

3. **Manage Storage**:
   - Monitor and clean up unused PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) and volumes.
   - Optimize storage configurations and backups.

4. **Update Resource Requests and Limits**:
   - Adjust resource requests and limits for deployments to match actual usage.

   - apiGroups: [""]
     resources: ["pods"]
     verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
   ```

3. **Use Network Policies**:
   - Define network policies to control traffic flow between pods.

   **Example Network Policy**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: allow-ingress
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         role: frontend
     ingress:
     - from:
       - podSelector:
           matchLabels:
             role: backend
   ```
