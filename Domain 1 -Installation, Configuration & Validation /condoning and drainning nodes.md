### Cordoning and Draining Nodes in Kubernetes

Cordoning and draining nodes are crucial steps in Kubernetes cluster maintenance, especially when performing upgrades or other administrative tasks. These operations ensure that no new pods are scheduled on the node, and existing pods are gracefully removed or rescheduled to other nodes.

---

### **Cordoning Nodes**

**Objective**: Prevent new pods from being scheduled on a specific node.

**Steps**:

1. **Cordoning a Node**:
   - Use the `kubectl cordon` command to mark the node as unschedulable. This means that no new pods will be scheduled on this node, but existing pods will continue to run until they are manually removed or rescheduled.
   - **Command**:
     ```sh
     kubectl cordon <node-name>
     ```

2. **Verify Node Status**:
   - Check the status of the node to ensure that it is marked as unschedulable.
   - **Command**:
     ```sh
     kubectl get nodes
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```plaintext
     NAME         STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
     node1        Ready    <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     node2        Ready    <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     node3        Ready    <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     node4        Ready    <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     node5        Ready    <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     ```

### **Draining Nodes**

**Objective**: Safely remove all pods from a node, ensuring that workloads are rescheduled and no data is lost.

**Steps**:

1. **Drain the Node**:
   - Use the `kubectl drain` command to evict all pods from the node. This command will also handle DaemonSets and local data, which are not evicted by default.
   - **Command**:
     ```sh
     kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
     ```
   - **Options**:
     - `--ignore-daemonsets`: Ignores DaemonSets, which run on all nodes. DaemonSets will continue to run on the node.
     - `--delete-local-data`: Deletes local data if any exists.

2. **Verify Pods Eviction**:
   - Check the status of the node to ensure that it is successfully drained and that all pods are rescheduled or removed.
   - **Command**:
     ```sh
     kubectl get nodes
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```plaintext
     NAME         STATUS                     ROLES    AGE   VERSION
     node1        Ready                      <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     node2        Ready                      <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     node3        Ready                      <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     node4        Ready                      <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     node5        SchedulingDisabled         <none>   30d   v1.21.0
     ```

3. **Reboot or Maintain Node**:
   - Perform maintenance or reboot the node as required.

4. **Uncordon Node**:
   - After maintenance, use `kubectl uncordon` to make the node schedulable again.
   - **Command**:
     ```sh
     kubectl uncordon <node-name>
     ```

5. **Verify Node Readiness**:
   - Ensure that the node is back in service and ready to schedule new pods.
   - **Command**:
     ```sh
     kubectl get nodes
     ```

### **Example Scenario**

**Scenario**: You need to perform a rolling upgrade on a Kubernetes node. Hereâ€™s how you would handle it:

1. **Cordoning the Node**:
   ```sh
   kubectl cordon node1
   ```

2. **Draining the Node**:
   ```sh
   kubectl drain node1 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data
   ```

3. **Perform Upgrade or Maintenance**:
   - Perform required operations on `node1`.

4. **Reboot Node**:
   ```sh
   sudo reboot
   ```

5. **Uncordon the Node**:
   ```sh
   kubectl uncordon node1
   ```

6. **Verify Node Readiness**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

### **Conclusion**

Cordoning and draining nodes are essential practices for managing Kubernetes clusters, particularly when performing maintenance or upgrades. By following these procedures, you ensure that workloads are properly managed, minimize disruptions, and maintain the overall health of the cluster.
